# C programing workbook and sample codes
Teaching at Hamburg University of Applied Sciences (HAW Hamburg) since 2010, I have created lots of material for my students over the years. For software development this includes sample codes used in lecture as well as __workbooks__ meant to apply, apply, and apply by practical coding. In the end it is all about building up practical competencies to be prepared for your profession - meaning, one must be able to _do things_, in contrast to merely _knowing_.

This raised the question, why not share material with ... well, _you_, for instance, in case you find it helpful for your students or yourself. So this is exactly what I do.

## Overview
- The workbook contains a large number of exercises (with sample solutions), questions, and extensive lab assignments.
- I am aware that the lecture sample codes would be far more valuable with the lecture slides provided. This may follow in future.
