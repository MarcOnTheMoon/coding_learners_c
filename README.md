# Learners' Workbooks for C and Java
Teaching at Hamburg University of Applied Sciences (HAW Hamburg) since 2010, I have created lots of material for my students over the years. For software development this includes "workbooks" meant to apply, apply, and apply by practical coding. In the end it is all about building up practical competencies to be prepared for your profession - meaning, one must be able to _do things_, in contrast to merely _knowing_.

This raised the question, why not share material  with ... well, _you_, for instance, in case you find it helpful for your students or yourself. So this is exactly what I'll do.

## Overview
In a first step, I will make material for the programming languages C and Java available. Other languages and topics (e.g., Arduino, Android  apps, image processing, AI) may follow in this or my other repositories, if time allows. Each workbook constists of a large number of exercises (with sample solutions provided), questions, and several more extensive lab assignments.

## Upload status (uploaded or still to come)
- [X] [Sample solutions](src/c/workbook/exercises) for C programming exercises
- [X] [Provided files](src/c/workbook/labs) for C lab assignments
- [ ] C and Java workbooks (documents)
- [ ] Java files (sample solutions, lab assignments)
- [ ] Further lecture material (docs, sample codes, etc.)
- [ ] Further languages or topics
